# Migration-Simulations


## Overview

This repo contains a script to simulate spatially explicit population trends during the stationary (i.e., "wintering" or breeding) part of the species' life cycle, then simulates migration dynamics across North America (which creates an emergent pattern of observed population trends along migration routes).

Simulations rely on eBird relative abundance maps to characterize preferred migration routes and relative abundance during different parts of the species' annual cycle.

## Uses

Used to clarify thinking about the way in which migration monitoring data are actually generated, and how to interpret migration trends in a national context.  

For example, this analysis shows that we probably can't estimate national trends by summing up site-specific indices of annual abundance across the migration range.

Can also use these simulations to test approaches to modeling (what types of data would be needed?)

## Issues

1) Need to improve the way in which migrants eventually "settle" at their eventual destinations.  Currently, they just keep moving north and do not correctly settle in breeding areas.
